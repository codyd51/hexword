#hexword

hexword generates all RGB combinations that can be interpreted as valid English words, according to `usr/share/dict/american-english`. The valid hex's are written to an output file, `hexword.txt`. 

To convert a hex code to a string of letters, we substitute numbers for their most logical alpha counterpart (i.e. 1 is substituted with 'I', 2 with 'Z', 3 with 'E', etc)
